0.3  Wed Jul 13 11:05:11 2022
        - added some POD to acknowledge Try::Tiny's
          exported 'try' keyword and early thoughs
          regarding the clobbering of this keyword.
          The TLDR; is to not export Tiny::ALRM::try
          and to reference it using the full namespace.
        - added example script using both modules
