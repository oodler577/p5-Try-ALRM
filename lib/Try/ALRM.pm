=head1 NAME

Try::ALRM - Provides C<try_once> and C<retry> semantics to C<CORE::alarm>, similar to
L<Try::Tiny>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The primary method in this module is meant to be C<retry>,

    retry {
      my ($attempts) = @_;                # @_ is populated as described in this line
      printf qq{Attempt %d/%d ... \n}, $attempts, tries;
      sleep 5;
    }
    ALRM {
      my ($attempts) = @_;                # @_ is populated as described in this line
      printf qq{\tTIMED OUT};
      if ( $attempts < tries ) {
          printf qq{ - Retrying ...\n};
      }
      else {
          printf qq{ - Giving up ...\n};
      }
    }
    finally {
      my ( $attempts, $successful ) = @_; # Note: @_ is populated as described in this line when called with retry
      my $tries   = tries;                # "what was the limit on number of tries?" Here it will be 4
      my $timeout = timeout;              # "what was the timeout allowed?" Here it will be 3

      # test and handle ultimate outcome after attempts
      if ($successful) {
        # timeout did NOT occur after $attempts attempts 
      }
      else {
        # timeout DID occur after trying $tries times
      }
    } timeout => 3, tries => 4;

Which is equivalent to ... well, checkout the implementation of C<Try::ALRM::retry(&;@)>,
because it is equivalent to that I<:-)>.

However, it should be pointed out that the module provides a method called, C<try_once>,
that is a reduced case of C<retry> where C<< tries => 1 >>.  There might be benefits to
using C<retry> instead, but the code might not ready very clearly with the workd I<retry>.
Originally, there was a method called C<try>, but because this might conflict with a more
popular module that exports a C<try> keyword, the decision was made to use C<try_once>.
It's not pretty, but it's clear.

    use Try::ALRM;
     
    try_once {
      my ($attempts) = @_;                # @_ is populated as described in this line
      print qq{ doing something that might timeout ...\n};
      sleep 6;
    }
    ALRM {
      my ($attempts) = @_;                # @_ is populated as described in this line
      print qq{ Wake Up!!!!\n};
    }
    finally {
      my ( $attempts, $successful ) = @_; # Note: @_ is populated as described in this line when called with retry
      my $tries   = tries;                # "what was the limit on number of tries?" Here it will be 4
      my $timeout = timeout;              # "what was the timeout allowed?" Here it will be 3

      # test and handle ultimate outcome after attempts
      if ($successful) {
        # timeout did NOT occur after $attempts attempts 
      }
      else {
        # timeout DID occur after trying $tries times
      }
    } timeout => 1;

Which is essentially equivalent to just,

    local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { print qq{ Wake Up!!!!\n} };
    alarm 1;
    print qq{ doing something that might timeout ...\n};
    sleep 6;
    alarm 0; # reset alarm, end of 'try' block implies this "reset"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Try::ALRM> provides I<try/catch>-like semantics for handling code being
guarded by C<alarm>. Because it's localized and I<probably> expected, C<ALRM>
signals can be treated as exceptions.

C<alarm> is extremely useful, but it can be cumbersome do add in code. The
goal of this module is to make it more idiomatic, and therefore more accessible.
It also allows for the C<ALRM> signal itself to be treated more semantically
as an exception. Which makes it a more natural to write and read in Perl.

Internally, the I<keywords> are implemented as prototypes and uses the same
sort of coersion of a lexical bloc to a subroutine reference that is used
in L<Try::Tiny>.

=head1 EXPORTS

This module exports 6 methods:

B<NOTE>: C<Try::ALRM::try_once> and C<Try::ALRM::retry> are mutually exclusive, but
one of them is I<required> to invoke any benefits of using this module.

=over 4

=item C<try_once BLOCK>

Meant to be used I<instead> of C<Try::ARLM::retry>.

Primary BLOCK, attempted once with a timeout set by C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>. If
an C<ALRM> signal is sent, the BLOCK described by C<ALRM> will be called to handle
the signal. If C<ALRM> is not defined, the normal mechanisms of handling C<$SIG{ALRM}>
will be employed. Mutually exclusive of C<retry>.

Accepts blocks: C<ALRM>, C<finally>; and trailing modifier C<< timeout => INT >>.

B<Note>: that C<try_once> is essentially a trival case of C<retry> with C<< tries => 1 >>; and
in the future it may just become a wrapper around this case. For now it is its own
independant implementation.

=item C<retry BLOCK>

Meant to be the primary method, not to be used with C<Try::ARLM::try_once>.

Primary BLOCK, attempted C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES> number of times with a timeout
governed by C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>. If an C<ALRM> signal is sent and the number
of C<tries> has not been exhausted, the C<retry> BLOCK will be tried again.
This continues until an C<ALRM> signal is not triggered or if the number of
C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES> has been reached.

Accepts blocks: C<ALRM>, C<finally>; and trailing modifiers C<< timeout => INT >>,
and C<< tries => INT >>.

C<retry> makes values available to each C<BLOCK> that is called via C<@_>, see
description of each BLOCK below for more details. This also applies to the BLOCK
provided for C<retry>.

I<NB>:

B<BLOCK> is treated as a C<CODE> block internally, and is passed a single value
that defines what number attempt, please see the examples; all of which contain
lines such as,

  my $attempts = shift;
  ...

=item C<ALRM BLOCK>

Optional.

Called when an C<ALRM> signal is detected. If no C<ALRM> BLOCK is defined and
C<$SIG{ALRM}> is not a assigned a C<CODE> ref to handle an I<ALRM> signal, then
not including the C<ALRM> block ends up being a I<no-op> in most cases.

When called with C<retry>, C<@_> contains the number of attempts that have been
made so far.

  retry {
    ...
  }
  ALRM {
    my ($attempts) = @_;
  };

I<NB>:

B<BLOCK> is treated as a C<CODE> block internally, and is passed a single value
that defines what number attempt, please see the examples; all of which contain
lines such as,

  my $attempts = shift;
  ...

=item C<finally BLOCK>

Optional.

This BLOCK is called unconditionally. When called with C<try_once>, C<@_> contains an
indication there being a timeout or not in the attempted block.

When called with C<retry>, C<@_> also contains the number of attempts that have been
made before the attempts ceased. There is also a value that is passed that indicates
if C<ALRM> had been invoked;

  ...
  finally {
    my ($attempts, $succeedful) = @_; 
  };

When used with C<try_once>, C<@_> is empty. Note that C<try_once> is essentially a trival case
of C<retry> with C<< tries => 1 >>; and in the future it may just become a wrapper around
this case.

B<BLOCK> is treated as a C<CODE> block internally, and is passed a single value
that defines what number attempt, please see the examples; all of which contain
lines such as,

  my ($attempts, $successful) = @_;
  ...

=item C<timeout INT>

Setter/getter for C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>, which governs the default timeout in number
of seconds. This can be temporarily overridden using the trailing modifier C<< timeout => INT >>
that is supported via C<try_once> and C<retry>. 

  timeout 10; # sets $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT to 10
  try_once {
    ...
  }
  ALRM {
    my ($attempts) = @_;
  };

Can be overridden by I<trailing modifier>, C<< timeout => INT >>.

The default value is in the code, but at the time of this writing
it is set to B<60> seconds.

=item C<tries INT>

Setter/getter for C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES>, which governs the number of attempts C<retry>
will make before giving up. This can be temporarily overridden using the trailing modifier
C<< tries => INT >> that is supported via C<retry>.

  timeout 10; # sets $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT to 10
  tries   12; # sets $Try:::ALRM::TRIES to 12 
  retry {
    ...
  }
  ALRM {
    my ($attempts) = @_;
  };

Can be overridden by I<trailing modifier>, C<< tries => INT >>.

The default value is in the code, but at the time of this writing
it is set to B<3> attempts.

=back

=head1 PACKAGE ENVIRONMENT

This module exposes C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT> and C<$TRY::ALRM::TRIES> as
package variables; they can be modified in traditional ways. The module also
provides different ways to set these at both script or package scope (using
the C<timeout> and C<tries> setters, respectively), and at a local execution
scope (using I<trailing modifiers>.

=head1 USAGE

L<Try::ALRM> doesn't really have options, it's more of a structure. So this
section is meant to descript that structure and ways to control it. 

=over 4

=item C<try_once>

This familiar idiom include the block of code that may run longer than one
wishes and is need of an C<alarm> signal.

  # default timeout is $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT
  try {
    this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  };

If just C<try_once> is used here, what happens is functionall equivalent to:

  alarm 60; # e.g., the default value of $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT
  this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  alarm 0;

And the default handler for C<$SIG{ALRM}> is invoked if an C<ALRM> is
ssued.

=item C<retry>

  # default timeout is $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT
  # default number of tries is $Try::ALRM::TRIES
  retry {
    this_subroutine_call_may_timeout_and_we_want_to_retry();
  };

=item C<ALRM>

This keyword is for setting C<$SIG{ALRM}> with the block that gets passed to
it; e.g.:

  # default timeout is $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT
  try {
    this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  }
  ALRM {
    print qq{ Alarm Clock!!!!\n};
  };

The addition of the C<ALRM> block above is functionally equivalent to the typical
idiom of using C<alarm> and setting C<$SIG{ALRM}>,

  local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { print qq{ Alarm Clock!!!!\n} };
  alarm 60; # e.g., the default value of $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT
  this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  alarm 0;

So while this module present C<alarm> with I<try/catch> semantics, there are no
actualy exceptions getting thrown via C<die>; the traditional signal handling mechanism
is being invoked as the exception handler.

=back

=head1 TRAILING MODIFIERS

A side effect of using Perl I<prototypes> to achieve the block structure of this module
is that passing options is much more naturally done so as a comma delimited list of
trailing I<key>/I<value> pairs at the end of the entire stucture.

As has been show in the previous examples, the modifiers are specifed as follows:

  retry {
    ...
  }
  ALRM {
    ...
  },
  finally {
    ...
  } timeout => 5, tries => 10;

  #^^ Note, there is NO comma between the closing '}' and 'timeout'; this
  # is due the implementation using a prototype that results in keyword syntax
  # similar to grep or map, e.g., map { } key1 => $val1, key2 => $val2;

This style of providing modifiers to the behavior of the C<retry>/C<try_once>
block is referred to here as I<trailing modifiers>.

This module has two trailing modifiers that can be set.

=over 4

=item C<< timeout => INT >>

Due to limitations with the way Perl prototypes work for creating syntactical structures,
the most idiomatic solution is to use a setter/getter function to update the package
variable:

  timeout 10; # changes $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT to 10
  try {
    this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  }
  ALRM {
    print qq{ Alarm Clock!!!!\n};
  };

If used without an input value, C<timeout> returns the current value of C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>.

=item Trailing after the last BLOCK

  try {
    this_subroutine_call_may_timeout();
  }
  ALRM {
    print qq{ Alarm Clock!!!!\n};
  } timeout => 10; # NB: applies temporarily!

This approach utilizes the effect of defining a Perl prototype, C<&>, which coerces a lexical
block into a subroutine reference (i.e., C<CODE>). The I<< key => value >> syntax was chosen as
a compromise because it makes things a lot more clear I<and> makes the implementation of the
blocks a lot easier (use the source to see how, I<Luke>).

The timeout value passed to C<alarm> internally is controlled with the package variable,
C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>. So this module presents 2 different ways to control the value of
this variable.

The addition of this timeout affects $Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT for the duration of the C<try_once> block,
internally is using C<local> to set C<$Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>. The reason for this is so that
C<timeout> may continue to function properly as a getter I<inside> of the C<try_once> block.

=item C<< tries => INT >>

Sets the number of attempts made by a C<retry> block. Impacts the value of C<Try::ALRM::TIMEOUT>
locally for each C<retry> block. See code examples in this document to see what a C<retry>
block with C<< tries => INT >> looks like.

=back

=head3 C<try_once>/C<ALRM>/C<finally> Examples

Using the two methods above, the following code demonstrats the usage of C<timeout> and the
effect of the trailing timeout value,

    # set timeout (persists)
    timeout 5;
    printf qq{now %d seconds timeout\n}, timeout;
     
    # try/ALRM
    try {
      printf qq{ doing something that might timeout before %d seconds are up ...\n}, timeout;
      sleep 6;
    }
    ALRM {
      print qq{Alarm Clock!!\n};
    } timeout => 1; # <~ trailing timeout
    
    # will still be 5 seconds
    printf qq{now %d seconds timeout\n}, timeout;

The output of this block is,

  default timeout is 60 seconds
  timeout is set globally to 5 seconds
  timeout is now set locally to 1 seconds
  Alarm Clock!!
  timeout is set globally to 5 seconds

=head2 Setting the Number of Tries

The number of total attempts made by C<retry> is controlled by the package variable,
C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES>. And it provides similar controls to what is provided for controlling
the timeout.

=over 4

=item Using the C<tries> keyword will affect the package variable C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES> if
passed an integer value. If passed nothing, the current value of C<$Try::ALRM::TRIES> will
be returned

=item Trailing value after the last BLOCK

An example is best here,

  retry {
    ...
  } timeout => 10, tries => 5;

Using the trailing values in this way allows the number of attempts to be temporarily
set to the RHS value of C<< tries => >>.

=back

=head1 Bugs

Very likey. This project was motivated by a couple of factors: learning
more about Perl I<prototypes> (which this author finds awesome) and
seeing if C<ALRM> can be treated as a localized exception (turns out,
I<it can!>).

Milage May Vary, as I<they> say. If found, please file issue on GH repo.

The module's purpose is essentially complete, and changes that are made
will be strictly to fix bugs in the code or POD. Please report them, and
I will find them eventually.
